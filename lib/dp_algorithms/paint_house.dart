/// üè† Paint House (DP)
///
/// Given a list of painting costs where costs[i][j] is the cost of painting
/// house `i` with color `j` (0..2), compute the minimum total cost such
/// that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
///
/// Contract:
/// - Input: non-null List<List<int>> where each inner list has length 3.
/// - Output: non-negative int representing the minimum painting cost.
///
/// Time Complexity: O(n)
/// Space Complexity: O(1)
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final costs = [
///   [17,2,17],
///   [16,16,5],
///   [14,3,19]
/// ];
/// expect(minCostPaintHouse(costs), equals(10));
/// ```
