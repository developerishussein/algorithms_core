/// ðŸ§  Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
///
/// A minimal, production-minded feed-forward neural network API. This class
/// exposes a generic, well-documented interface for building multi-layer
/// perceptrons with configurable layer sizes, activation functions, and
/// training parameters. The implementation favors clarity, numerical safety,
/// and explicitness suitable for engineering evaluation and extension.
///
/// Contract:
/// - Input: feature matrix X (n x m) as List<List<double>> and target Y.
/// - Output: trained weights and a `predict` method which returns model outputs.
/// - Errors: throws ArgumentError for invalid shapes and StateError if used before fit.
///
/// Notes: This implementation is intentionally lightweight (no GPU) and
/// designed to be a maintainable, auditable building block rather than a
/// high-performance library.
