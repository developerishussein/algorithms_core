/// üñºÔ∏è Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
///
/// A compact, clear CNN primitive focused on small-image conv-nets. Provides a
/// documented API for configurable convolutional layers, pooling, and a final
/// classifier head. Prioritizes clarity and extensibility rather than GPU
/// performance. Good for unit-testing, education, and small engineering
/// prototypes.
///
/// Contract:
/// - Input: image batch X (n x h x w x c) represented as nested lists.
/// - Output: logits or probabilities from the classifier head.
/// - Errors: throws ArgumentError for invalid shapes.
///
/// Note: This implementation is a pure-Dart CPU implementation intended as a
/// well-documented reference-grade algorithm; optimized libraries should be
/// used for production training at scale.
